# Bus Transportation Dashboard

Code4Baltimore was tasked with creating a dashboard showcasing route information and bus performance for the city bus service.  I was assigned to create to create a front-end using React/Redux and any graphing or chart library that would display the required content.  This POC was the first iteration of the project before it was handed off to a private company for completion.  The libraries I chose involved the following:

 - Leaflet JS (Geo Mapping)
 - React-vis (Bar Graphs)
 - MDB Datables (Bootrap 4 Data tables library for React)
 - Bootstrap (Styling)

## How to run

1. Run `npm install` in the root of the project to install the necessary external dependencies.

1. Run `npm start` to boot up the application on the port `3000` under localhost. If you have something running on this port already, don't worry, it will prompt you to choose another port.
